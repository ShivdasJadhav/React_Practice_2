Hallow Friends, this is my second project, Build in ReactJs.
In this project i have created two sides..
1) login creditionals
2) secrete page

In the "login" page you must login to get on secrete page. On login page you have to submit three terms that are as follows...
1) user name
2) password
3) mail id

After filling-up this form, when you login, you will redirected to the secrete page. If you missed any thing on login page by filling-up, it will return an alert to you while getting login, about what? you have missed.
When you on secrete page, you will see some blocks having links for the Documentaries and a "logout button" at the top right corner of the page. Remember that don't forget to logout, when you want to close the secrete page.else when you will open up the page again, it will redirect you to the secrete page.
